         <b>Senior Software Engineer at Mobilewalla Singapore</b>
         <span class='floatRight'>May 2014 - Now</span>
      </p>
	  <p class='compPara'>
	  Mobilewalla is a fast growing adtech startup. I was mainly involved in our demand-side platform (bidding) product and our data initiative
	  </p>
      <ul class='lowTopMargin'>
         <li>
			 <p class='compPara'>Contributed to a system crawling data from various sources to be used as signals to classify mobile bid stream data. (Java)
			 <br/>We build classifiers using these signals crawled from different places. 
			 The crawling process for each source would be different, and reasons for failure could be different. 
			 We build a process that crawls the parts using a best-effort and fail-safe approach.
			 </p>
		 </li>
		 <li>
			 <p class='compPara'>Built the Post Campaign Analysis(PCA) system which adds insights to our campaign data and display the insights to clients. (Java)
			 <br/>I took over this product at infant stage and built upon it applying best practices using Redshift. 
			 My efforts included, for example, designing batching strategy that fits well with how Redshift ingests data, designing database schema more suited for quries we run. 
			 </p>
         <li>
			 <p class='compPara'>Designed and realized a system extracting features from a large volumn of data to be classified. (Java, Scala)
			 <br/>In Mobilewalla, we collect tens of terrabytes of data a day and we need to make use of all the data from day to day within a look-back window. 
			 To achieve that, we extract features from daily data and aggregate these features within the look-back window to produce a managble amount of data to use and to classify. 
			 <br/>The challenges I have tackled in this system revolves around processing a huge amount of data reliably on schedule and to make sure the data processed can be used by our classification system efficiently.
			 </p>
		 </li>
         <li>
		     <p class='compPara'>Worked on a system that allows applying user defined classifiers to classify a large volumn of data. (Java, Scala)
			 <br/>I contributed to the backend of our data classification system which powers Mobilewalla's mobile audience data business. 
			 This system sift through a large amount of data and try to put these data into buckets to be shipped under different tags for our clients. 
			 Efforts building this system includes, for exmaple, building the classifiers efficiently, building tools to assist in monitoring the system and so on.

         <b>Internship at Tigerspike Singapore</b>
         <span class='floatRight'>May 2013 - Sept 2013</span>
      </p>
	  <p class='compPara'>
	  Tigerspike is a digital product company. I contributed mainly to its web services platform Phoenix. 
	  </p>
      <ul class='lowTopMargin'>
         <li>
			 <p class='compPara'>Worked on documentation site and test suite for Phoenix (C#)
			 <br/>Phoenix's documentation site uses a reflection model to generate documentations automatically with each build. Besides bug fixes, I built a new feature where a live request-response will be displayed in the documentation site so examples will no longer need to be hard-coded. 
			 <br/>I revamped test suite for Phoenix on SoapUI with some scripting in Groovy</p>
